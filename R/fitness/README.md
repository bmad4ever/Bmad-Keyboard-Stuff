| AuxFunctions.R                   |  Implements auxiliary methods that are used in Fitness.R.                                              |
| QueriesAndDefinitions.R          |  Auxiliary data and queries for effort estimation.                                                     |
| ./efforts                        |  Effort matrices and functions that are used to estimate the cost of certain finger/hand motions.      |
| ./constraints                    |  Constraints to be used in the final fitness function as a means to enforce certain layout properties that may not be related to effort.|
