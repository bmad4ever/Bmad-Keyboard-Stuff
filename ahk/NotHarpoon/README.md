### Allows to bind windows to keys for quick navigation; and provides some utilities for window management.


### Configuration : The key bindings can be edited in the KEY MAPS section, at the top of the script file. 


## How to use

Open the window you want to bind and hold the <kbd>trigger</kbd> key (default is <kbd>F24</kbd>).

While holding <kbd>trigger</kbd> tap on the <kbd>binder</kbd> key (default is <kbd>H</kbd>).

Now you can bind the window to any key in the `harpoon_keys` list.

Once the window is deactivated, you can re-activate it by holding <kbd>trigger</kbd> and tapping on the previously assigned key. 

Et voil√†, quick window navigation at the tip of your fingers.

### Quick Layout commands

With `trigger` held, tap one of the 9 keys in the `layout_keys` to quickly adjust the active window position & dimensions.

For ease of use, I recommend that you set the `layout_keys` in a 3x3 key grid. For example, in a qwerty keyboard, it could be: `q w e a s d z x c`.
