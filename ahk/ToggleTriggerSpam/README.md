# Toggle Trigger Spam (TTS)

The script allows to trigger <b>SPAM MODE</b>.
When in <b>SPAM MODE</b>, if any <b>trigger key</b> is pressed then the key defined as <b>spam key</b> is also sent.

The <b>toggle key</b>, <b>spam key</b>, and <b>trigger keys</b> can be defined in the CONFIGS section, lines 32 to 39.

Note that despite the <b>spam key</b> being set to the same key as the <b>toggle key</b> by default it is possible to assign two different keys for each.


## Usage

The primary purpose of this script is to be used in games and interactive applications that have a hold button functionality for movement or camera control but do not have a toggle option, or, do have a toggle but the toggle has some undesired "neutral behavior" (when not pressing other keys).

Example:
- In a game, change the hold key sprint/boost/turbo functionality to a toggle;
- In the example above, if the game also has a toggle funtionality option but this results in undesired movement or actions when nothing is being pressed. Set the game funtionality to hold and use this script instead.


## Toggle Trigger Spam for Controllers (TTS4C)

The script provides the same functionality as TTS for controllers.

Not fully tested (experimental).
