# <img src="eye-open.ico" alt="icon" width="32" height="32"/> &nbsp; Mod Keys States

## AlwaysDisplayModStates.ahk

Small gui that shows whether is Shift, Ctrl, Alt or the Windows key is 'pressed' (maybe not physically when using qmk). Also shows whether CapsLock is active or not.

The gui can be hidden without stoping the script using the last custom option that appears when right clicking the script tray icon.



## DisplayActiveModStates.ahk

A gui that only appears when a mod key is 'pressed'. Will not show CapsLock state.

To deactivate the gui without removing the script from the tray section right click it and select 'Pause script'. Repeat this to reactivate it.
